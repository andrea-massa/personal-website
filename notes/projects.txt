DESIGN SECTION

        Title:
            FitForm
        Skills Used:
            Teamwork, UX & UI, Personas, User journeys, HCD, Prototyping, Figma, User Studies.
        Description:  
            A design concept to a mobile application using AI as personal fitness assistant. This design focuses
            particularly on weightlifing and correcting user's form during excercise. I have created FitForm along with
            two additional undergraduate students from UNCC. The process started with the development of three design goals and
            ended with a high level functional prototype and a full design report powered by user research. FitForm has helped me
            and my fellow classmates to deeply understand the full human centered design process. This was achieved thanks to a
            hands on approach and feedback from both: users and a professional in the field.
